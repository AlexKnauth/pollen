Garner, <book>Garner’s Modern American Usage</book>, 3rd ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009).</p><p><indented style="position:relative;top:-0.4em">Long before he agreed to write the foreword for my book <book>Typography for Lawyers</book>, Bryan Garner was a hero of mine. Garner thinks and writes about American English in a way that’s rigorous, convincing, and accessible. He is stern but not shrill; authoritative but not authoritarian. He is a vigorous advocate for clear, simple writing. His work should be mandatory reading for all writers.</indented></p><p><subhead>Typography</subhead></p><p>Matthew Butterick, <book>Typography for Lawyers</book> (Houston: Jones McClure Publishing, 2010).</p><p><indented style="position:relative;top:-0.4em">The precursor to <book>Butterick’s Practical Typography</book>.
