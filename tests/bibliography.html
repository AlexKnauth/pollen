Garner thinks and writes about American English in a way that’s rigorous, convincing, and accessible. He is stern but not shrill; authoritative but not authoritarian. He is a vigorous advocate for clear, simple writing. His work should be mandatory reading for all writers.psubheadTypographypMatthew Butterick, bookTypography for Lawyers (Houston: Jones McClure Publishing, 2010).pindentedstyleposition:relative;top:-0.4emThe precursor to bookButterick’s Practical Typography.
