#lang racket/base

;; Changes the default behavior of #%top.
;; Unbound identifiers are allowed, and treated as the 
;; tag in a tagged-xexpr (with the rest of the expression treated as the body)
;; To suppress this behavior, use bound/c to wrap any name.
;; If that name isn't already defined, you'll get the usual syntax error.
