Pollen
------

A book-publishing system written in Racket. Unstable. Incomplete. Et cetera. I'm working on making it more civilized. But it is the actual software I use to publish & maintain my web-based book [Butterick's Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com).

Install from the command line like so:

    raco pkg install pollen

Scribble docs are installed with the package.
